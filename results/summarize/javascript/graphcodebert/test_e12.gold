1258	Synchronsly updates the DOM element associated with a component object . . This method assumes the presence of . element and . virtualNode properties on the component which are assigned in the initialize function .

During the patch operation it pushes the component s refs object to a shared stack so that references to DOM elements can be updated . If update is called during the invocation of updateSync the requests are processed synchronously as well . We track whether this is the case by incrementing and decrementing syncUpdatesInProgressCounter around the call . For now etch does not allow the root tag of the render method to change between invocations because we want to preserve a one - to - one relationship between component objects and DOM elements for simplicity .

1257	This function associates a component object with a DOM element by calling the components render method assigning an . element property on the object and also returning the element . It also assigns a virtualNode property based on the return value of the render method .

Finally this function also associates the component with a refs object which is populated with references to elements based on ref properties on nodes of the virtual - dom tree .
