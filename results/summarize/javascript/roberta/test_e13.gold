1258	Synchronsly updates the DOM element associated with a component object . . This method assumes the presence of . element and . virtualNode properties on the component which are assigned in the initialize function . It calls render on the component to obtain the desired state of the DOM then diff s it with the previous state and patch es the element based on the resulting diff . During the patch operation it pushes the component s refs object to a shared stack so that references to DOM elements can be updated . If update is called during the invocation of updateSync the requests are processed synchronously as well . We track whether this is the case by incrementing and decrementing syncUpdatesInProgressCounter around the call . For now etch does not allow the root tag of the render method to change between invocations because we want to preserve a one - to - one relationship between component objects and DOM elements for simplicity .
